1.Lola, Bergamasco Shepherd (10 y/o), Central Park, New York, NY • “People gasp when they see her. They call her ‘Dog Marley’. If we don’t get stopped 50 times a day in the park it’s a slow day. She’s hypoallergenic, so she doesn’t need to be bathed often, but it takes her two days to dry when we do bath her. She hates the bath. You’d think we were killing her when she gets a bath – the howling and whining. Their coats start matting between 9-15 months, and they become flocks – basically flat dreadlocks – and you have to tear them into the size you want. She’s loving this weather. The colder the better.” (Puppy photo provided by owner)


2.Maggie, Bagle (Beagle/Basset Hound mix; 10 m/o), Surprise Farms Community Park, Surprise, AZ • “She’s a hoarder of the toys. She takes them all under the bed.”

3.Charlie, Shih-poo (6 m/o), Mather Point, Grand Canyon Village, AZ • “He chews socks. We give him all of the phantom socks from the dryer.” @adventuresofcharlie_the_dog

4.Indi, French Bulldog (4 m/o), AKC National Championship Dog Show, Orlando, FL • “She’s very determined – nothing stops her. She learned stairs in a day.”

5.Tuppee, French Bulldog (9 y/o), Washington Square Park, New York, NY • “His name means ladle in Thai. We’re both chefs – we named him after the utensil we use the most.” @tuppee_nyc_frenchie

6.Indiana Jones, Peekapoo (10 y/o), Surprise, AZ • "We got him ten years ago on Christmas Eve. He's genuinely the most non-problematic dog. Once you have kids you just need a dog that's not a pain in the butt. We can leave the door wide open and he won't run away. We've named all of our small dogs after macho movie actors. Our last dog was named Rocky Balboa."
